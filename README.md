# Tic-Tac-Toe-with-AI
Project completed as part of a JetBrains Academy course.

This TicTacToe game allows gameplay in the forms user-user, user-CPU and CPU-CPU. The CPU player has three difficulty levels:

Easy: Makes a random move every time, always ensuring to place a marker on an empty space.

Medium: If it's about to win it makes the winning move. In the case that an opponent is about to win, it blocks the opponent's move. Otherwise, it makes a random move.

Hard: The hard level uses the MiniMax algorithm https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax to make the optimal move at each stage in the game.
